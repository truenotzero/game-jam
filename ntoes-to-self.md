# Notes to self
👍 is good\
👎 is bad\
📝 is an interesting note

## Rendering
* 👍 backend agnostic renderer
* 👍 total separation of rendering/logic code
* 👎 tedious to set up 'trivial' renderers

## Logic
* 👍 delta time
* 👎 tedious to set up 'trivial' components
* 👎 no dedicated event system
* 👍 dynamic properties + helper methods (get/set/with/with_mut)


## Other / ToDo's
* 👎 tedious to manage 4 different vector types
* 📝 vec4 based linalg library with type aliases for position and direction
* 📝 mpsc::channel based event system
